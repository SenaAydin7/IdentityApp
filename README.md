# IdentityApp
With this application, I created users, assigned them roles and gave them permissions according to the roles. When creating an account, I set certain conditions for the username and password.
After creating the user, I sent an e-mail for account confirmation. For this, I used an e-mail platform and tested temporary e-mails and action methods.
Finally, I added the password change process using the same method.
